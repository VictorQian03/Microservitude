# Execution Cost Estimator

Phase 1 of the execution cost estimator focuses on the core domain logic for computing trading costs using percent-of-ADV and square-root impact models. The repository currently ships the calculation logic, accompanying abstractions, and unit tests. Phase 2 creates the Postgres database, runs Alembic migrations in db/, and seeds initial data for symbols, liquidity, and impact models.

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.10+ 
- PostgreSQL 13+

## Setup

1. Create and activate a virtual environment (recommended):
   ```bash
   python -m venv .venv
   source .venv/bin/activate
   ```
2. Install the project in editable mode with the dev and db extras:
   ```bash
   pip install -e '.[dev]'
   pip install -e '.[db]'
   ```

This installs the core dependency (`pydantic`) and the development dependency (`pytest`).

### 1 Start Postgres in Docker
```bash
# one-time named volume for persistence
docker volume create costdb_pg

# run Postgres 16 on localhost:5432 with default creds and DB name "costdb"
docker run -d --name costdb \
  -e POSTGRES_USER=postgres \
  -e POSTGRES_PASSWORD=postgres \
  -e POSTGRES_DB=costdb \
  -p 5432:5432 \
  -v costdb_pg:/var/lib/postgresql/data \
  postgres:16

# wait until ready
docker exec costdb pg_isready -U postgres
```

# Migrate schema using built-in defaults
   ```bash
   ce-db-up
   ```

# Seed initial data
   ```bash
   ce-db-seed
   ```

# To reset everything to defaults
   ```bash
   ce-db-reset
   ```

## Running the Unit Tests

Execute the calculator tests via:
```bash
python -m pytest
```

Pytest is configured to discover tests in the `tests/` directory and runs quietly by default.

## Latency Benchmarks

The `benchmarks/` module provides lightweight latency checks for the core calculators. To exercise the defaults (100 warmup iterations, 1000 recorded runs per case), run:
```bash
python benchmarks/calculator_latency.py
```

You can tweak iterations with `--warmup` and `--runs` to explore different sampling depths.

## Whatâ€™s Next

Future phases will add infrastructure adapters (Postgres, Redis, RQ) and FastAPI/RQ entrypoints. Those components will build on the core abstractions already present in `cost_estimator/core`.
